    <h5>ACT II
        [SCENE.— The same— Moonlight.]

            [Two days have elapsed.]
    </h5>
<h6>CHORUS</h6>
<p>Night has spread her pall once more,
    And the pris'ner still is free:
    Open is his dungeon door,
    Useless now his dungeon key.
    He has shaken off his yoke—
    How, no mortal man can tell!
    Shame on loutish jailor-folk</p>
    
<h6>DAME</h6>  
<p> Warders are ye?
    Whom do ye ward?
Warders are ye?
    Whom do ye ward?
Bolt, bar, and key,
    Shackle and cord,
Fetter and chain,
    Dungeon and stone,
All are in vain—
    Prisoner's flown!
Spite of ye all, he is free— he is free!
Whom do ye ward? Pretty warders are ye!</p>         
   
<h6>WOMEN</h6>  
<p>
    Night has spread her pall once more,
    And the pris'ner still is free:</p>            
     

<h6>WILFRED</h6> 
<p>
    Aye, it's well for thee to laugh. Thou hast a good
    post, and hast cause to be merry.</p>  
    
<h6>POINT</h6>  
<p>
    She did nothing of the kind, so hold thy peace and
    perpend. Now, while he liveth she is dead to me and I
    to her, and so, my jibes and jokes notwithstanding, I
    am the saddest and the sorriest dog in England!
</p>   
       

<h6>FAIRFAX</h6> 
<P>  Well, Sergeant Meryll, and how fares thy pretty
        charge,Elsie Maynard?
</P>
<h6>DAME</h6> 
<p>
    Nay, Sergeant Meryll, don't go. I have something of
        grave import to say to thee.
</p>     
<h6>ALL</h6> 
<p>He is free! He is free!
    Pretty warders are ye/we!</p>          
 

<p>
    [Exeunt all.
